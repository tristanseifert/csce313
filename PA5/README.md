# Programming Assignment 5
Here's the fifth programming assignment, an improved multithreaded client/server program with one or more worker threads handling more than one channel to the server.

See `PA5.pdf` for more info about the assignment.

## Extra Credit
The number of worker threads can be changed by the `-t` switch. By default, only one worker thread is spawned.
