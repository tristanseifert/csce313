# CSCE 313 Programming Assignments
Programming assignments for CSCE 313 Fall 2018 (with Prof. Tanzir) at Texas A&M.

## What is this?
This code is published as a resource to help other students. It's intended to be a source of inspiration on how to solve a particular problem, and as an example of how particular system functions work. What this isn't is code you can blindly copy/paste -- that will screw you over on future assignments, exams, and other CSCE courses: plus, that's stealing, and stealing isn't cool.

As always, remember the Aggie Honor Code:

> An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do.
